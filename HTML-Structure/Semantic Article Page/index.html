          An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus pumila).
          Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown
          species in the genus <em>Malus</em>. The tree originated in Central Asia,
          where its wild ancestor, <em>Malus sieversii</em>, is still found today.

          Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and
          were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have
          religious and mythological significance in many cultures.
